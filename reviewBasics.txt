(1) var vs. let / const
    var is function scope;
    let and const are block scope.
    
(2) More about for-loop
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
    code block to be executed
}

// Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
// Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
// Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

    for (variable of iterable) {
      statement
    }
    
// e.g.
// Iterating over a String

let iterable = 'boo';
for (let value of iterable) {
  console.log(value);
}
// "b"
// "o"
// "o"

// A for...in loop only iterates over enumerable, non-Symbol properties.
