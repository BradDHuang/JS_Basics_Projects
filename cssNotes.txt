A preprocessor 
is a program 
that takes 
one type of data 
and converts it 
to another type of data. 

In the case of HTML and CSS, 
some of the more popular preprocessor languages include Haml and Sass . 

Haml 
is processed into HTML; 

Sass 
(Syntactically awesome style sheets)
is processed into CSS.
// Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade 
// CSS extension language

Less 
(Leaner Style Sheets; sometimes stylized as LESS) 
// a backwards-compatible language extension for CSS
// Backward compatible 
// refers to a hardware or software system that can use the interface of 
// an older version of the same product. 
is a 
dynamic 
preprocessor style sheet language 
that can be compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
and run on the client side or server side.
