A preprocessor 
is a program 
that takes 
one type of data 
and converts it 
to another type of data. 

In the case of HTML and CSS, 
some of the more popular preprocessor languages include Haml and Sass . 

Haml 
is processed into HTML; 

Sass 
(Syntactically awesome style sheets)
is processed into CSS.
// Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade 
// CSS extension language

Less 
(Leaner Style Sheets; sometimes stylized as LESS) 
// a backwards-compatible language extension for CSS
// Backward compatible 
// refers to a hardware or software system that can use the interface of 
// an older version of the same product. 
is a 
dynamic 
preprocessor style sheet language 
that can be compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
and run on the client side or server side.

CSS: 
What is the difference between 'resetting' and 'normalizing' CSS? 
Which would you choose and why?

CSS resets 
aim to remove all built-in browser styling. 
Standard elements like h1 - h6, p, strong, em end up looking exactly alike, 
having no decoration at all. 
// You're then supposed to add all decoration yourself.
Resetting: 
Removing all styling from every element - margins, padding, etc. 
All elements will have the same font-size, same line-height and no spacing. 

Normalize.css 
aims to make built-in browser styling consistent across browsers. 
Elements like h1 - h6 will appear bold, larger et cetera 
in a consistent way across browsers. 
// You're then supposed to add only the difference in decoration your design needs.

Normalizing: 
Making elements render consistently across browsers. 
So all h1s will have the same size across browsers, for instance. 

I personally prefer normalizing over resetting. 
There's no point in resetting everything 
only to style it again.
