Model View Controller (MVC) 
is a software architecture pattern, 
commonly used to implement user interfaces (UIs): 
it is therefore a popular choice for architecting web apps. 

In general, it separates out the application logic into 3 separate parts, 
promoting modularity and ease of collaboration and reuse. 
It also makes applications more 
flexible 
and welcoming to iterations.

The model 
defines what data 
the app should contain. 
// If the state of this data changes, 
// then the model will usually notify the view (so the display can change as needed) 
// and sometimes the controller.

The view 
defines how the app's data should be 
displayed.

The controller 
contains logic 
that updates the model and/or view 
in response to input from the users of the app.
