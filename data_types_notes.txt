DATA TYPE - NULL & UNDEFINED
• Both have one possible value:
    • null
    • undefined

• Both represent something that doesn’t exist.

• Difference:
    • null is usually available to programmers.
    • undefined should be reserved for JavaScript itself, 
      to indicate that something hasn’t been given a value yet.
