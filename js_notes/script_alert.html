	<h1>Most modern browsers now wait until the script finishes 
	before 
	rendering the page. 
	This is a change in the common behavior.</h1>
	<p id='p1'>Line 1</p>
	<script type='text/javascript'>
	    document.write("<p>Line1 is null? " + (document.getElementById('p1') == null ? "yes" : "no") + "</p>");
	    alert('Hello JavaScript!');
	    document.write("<p>Line2 is null? " + (document.getElementById('p2') == null ? "yes" : "no") + "</p>");
	</script>
	<p id='p2'>Line 2</p>
	<p> Line1 exists as of when the script runs, but Line2 doesn't.
	</p>
	<p> When the browser encounters a script tag when parsing the HTML, 
		it stops parsing and hands over to the JS interpreter, which runs the script. 
		Only when the script is complete does the browser resume parsing the page 
		(because the script might do document.write calls to output markup that the parser should handle). 
		This is the default behavior; 
		there are script tag attributes that can prevent this (defer and async).
	</p>
	<p> Where it gets a bit tricky is interacting with the DOM, 
		since the DOM is built up by the parser as it's doing its thing and your script may run 
		before 
		the DOM is completely ready to be manipulated. 
		In general, if you only access elements that precede the script tag in the file, you're fine, 
		but to be safe it's best to put off any DOM interactions until the DOM is fully built.
